**** Welcome to the online Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition System
Reference Document v5.1 in Markdown Format!

--------------

*The Systems Reference Document (SRD)* contains guidelines for
publishing content under the Open-Gaming License (OGL). The
[[http://dungeonmastersguild.com/][Dungeon Masters Guild]] also provides
self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and
Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities.
For an overview of the programs, please visit the official
[[http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd][Wizards
SRD page]].

*Why Markdown format?* Markdown is a lightweight markup language with
plain text formatting syntax created by
[[https://daringfireball.net][John Gruber]]. It is designed so that it
can be converted to HTML and many other formats. Markdown is often used
to create readme files, for writing messages in online discussion
forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

! The documents contained herein are edited from scratch into Markdown
format for portability and conversion to other formats. This is not a
basic conversion as you find elsewhere, we have painstakingly converted
the original Wizard's SRD PDF to markdown paragraph-by-paragraph. The
original documents can be downloaded from our
[[https://github.com/sigillumrasa/OGL-SRD5][Sigillum-Rasa GitHub
repository]]. Please report any issues you find through our GitHub
account. Thank you!
